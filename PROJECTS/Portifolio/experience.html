            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained hands-on experience with a variety of
                frameworks and tools. These experiences have helped me develop a versatile skill set that I continuously
                refine. Here are some of the frameworks I have worked with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>React Native:</strong> Used for developing cross-platform mobile applications with a focus
                    on performance and user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Flutter:</strong> Leveraged for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and
                    desktop from a single codebase.</li>
                <li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> Utilized for responsive web design to ensure my web applications are
                    mobile-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
                <li><strong>Django:</strong> Implemented to create robust and scalable web applications with a powerful
                    backend.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These frameworks have enabled me to work on diverse projects, enhancing my problem-solving skills and
                adaptability to different development environments.</p>
